# Prisma ORM, Just the Basics

## This repo servers as a starter repo using Prisma with PostgreSQL, and Express

##### To run this locally:

```git clone git@github.com:pawanbenjamin/simplePrisma.git```

```npm install```

 ```createdb pupsNstuff``` locally

Make sure to create a ```.env``` file with
```DATABASE_URL="postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"```

##### DO NOT CHECK INTO GITHUB!!!!

Then you can build your schema in your ```prisma/schema.prisma``` file

To then perform the db migration:
```npx prisma migrate dev```

While you develop, you can also push changes by
```npx prisma db push```

When seeding needed, run ```npx prisma db seed``` to run the seed file at ```db/seed.js```
##### This repo drops and builds tables before seeding

## The following is from the Prisma Docs:
[DOCS](https://www.prisma.io/docs/)
#### If you want to set up a project with Prisma From Scratch:
##### Setup a new Prisma project
  ```npx prisma init```

##### Generate artifacts (e.g. Prisma Client)
  ```npx prisma generate```
  (so you can):

##### Browse your data
  ```npx prisma studio```

##### Create migrations from your Prisma schema, apply them to the database, generate artifacts (e.g. Prisma Client)
  ```npx prisma migrate dev```
  
 ##### Pull the schema from an existing database, updating the Prisma schema
  ```npx prisma db pull```


##### Push the Prisma schema state to the database
  ```npx prisma db push```

```npx prisma migrate dev``` (seed command is run here as well as pushing our schema to your db)
also there is ```prisma migrate deploy``` for dev

or ```npx prisma migrate reset```
Prisma Migrate resets the database and triggers seeding in the following scenarios:

1.You manually run the ```npx prisma migrate reset``` CLI command.

2.The database is reset interactively in the context of using prisma migrate dev 
   - for example, as a result of migration history conflicts or database schema drift.

---> When you want to use ```npx prisma migrate dev``` or ```npx prisma migrate reset``` without seeding, 
---> you can pass the ``` --skip-seed``` flag.
